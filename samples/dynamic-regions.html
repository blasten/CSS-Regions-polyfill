<h2>The jobs family</h2>

<p class="capital">
Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in the city of San Francisco. His biological mother was an unwed graduate student named Joanne Simpson,
and his biological father was either a political science or mathematics professor, a native Syrian named Abdulfattah John Jandali.
</p>


<p>
Being born out of wedlock in the puritan America of the 1950s, the baby
was put up for adoption. Joanne had a college education, and she insisted that the future parents of her boy be just as well educated. Unfortunately,
the candidates, Paul and Clara Jobs, did not meet her expectations: they were a lower-middle class couple that had settled in the Bay Area after the
war. Paul was a machinist from the Midwest who had

<p>Yet, once again, the market proved the critics wrong, 
and iPad turned out an amazing success. Apple sold 7.5 million of them as of September 2010,
representing close to 8% of its 2010 fiscal-year revenues (iPods amounted for 13%).

It is worth thinking about these comments for a minute.

If we assume Steve Jobs is right about this, and almost everyone (but Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer) agrees he is, then he will be a unique case in history of someone who has been instrumental in both creating and putting an end to an industry.

<h2>Apple’s possible future</h2>
<p>
2010 has seen Apple’s dominance in the high-tech industry reinforced. The company is the market leader or a dominant player in four huge and growing markets: digital music players (with iPod), digital music distribution (with iTunes), smartphones and mobile apps (with iPhone, iPod touch and the App Store), and tablet PCs (with iPad).
</p>

<p>
This unique position at the crossroads of the digital revolution, makes the fruit company the subject of many a fantasy. Two trends have constantly re- emerged when speculating on Apple’s future.
</p>

<p>
The first is its take on the television market. Steve Jobs himself has commented at length on it at D8 (again), saying it was impossible for Apple
to enter this market because of its structure. He talked about an insoluble go-to-market impossibility.
</p>
</div>
<span class="page-number">102</span><div class="book-content">


<p>
<img class="left-pic zoom-this" src="samples/steve-jobs/pics/47.jpg" width="120" height="162">
Yet only three months later, he introduced a revamped, network-based
Apple TV at the traditional September Apple Media Event. The new box is iOS-based and most people think it won’t be long before it runs iOS apps.
To speak more generally, it is very likely that, unlike what Steve Jobs has explained, Apple will try very hard to enter and revolutionize this “other”
consumer electronics space that is television, and the Living Room in general — following a strategy that was conceived some four years earlier
with iPod hi-fi.
</p>

<p>
Another controversial issue is that of Apple’s relation toward its new arch- rival, Google. This relation is controversial because for several years, Google
was not an enemy, but an ally in the war against the behemoth of Redmond, Microsoft. Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt even

<p class="no-indent">
sat on Apple’s board
of directors for three whole years, from 2006 to 2009. But it’s no wonder he left in 2009: by entering the smartphone market with its Android mobile OS
(and its own app store!), Google had become a direct competitor of Apple. This confict of interest was as good a reason for him to leave, as Steve Jobs’
shrinking tolerance for what he felt was a plain and simple betrayal.
</p>

<h2>Has Steve changed?</h2>
<p>
Finally, an old debate about Steve’s personality has also re-emerged in
2010: has he changed? Although some of his traits, such as his propensity to take the spotlight then and again to unveil insanely great products to the
world, have not changed... People have noticed two minor evolutions in his public persona.
</p>

<p>The first is his increasing habit of communicating by writing emails to
customers.
</p> 

</div>

<p class="no-indent">
them, so often. Usually, he has used them to publicly respond to hot issues about Apple or to spread rumors himself. Some even pretend he has theorized this method, which is in essence a new way for CEOs to deal with PR, bypassing the traditional press.
</p>

<p>
<img class="left-pic zoom-this" src="samples/steve-jobs/pics/48.jpg" width="120" height="124">
Another change is more profound, and has to do with his implication on
charity issues. Steve’s reputation in Silicon Valley was not very positive on this particular topic, as he was often dismissed for basically being stingy.
Yet, in addition to large donations to charities, he spoke publicly twice for the defense of organ donations in 2010, and even played a critical role in
the creation of the nations’ first organ donor registry in October 2010. This was obviously a praiseworthy side effect of the liver transplant that had
saved his life one year earlier.

not even graduated from high school. In the end, Joanne agreed to have her baby adopted by
them, under the firm condition that they later send him to college.
</p>

<p>
Paul and Clara called their new son Steven Paul. While Steve was still a toddler, the couple moved to the Santa Clara county, later to be known as
Silicon Valley. They adopted another baby, a girl called Patti, three years later in 1958.
</p>

<h2>Childhood</h2>

<p> 
<img class="left-pic zoom-this" src="samples/steve-jobs/pics/young.jpg?" width="100" height="113">Steve was quite a turbulent child. He really didn’t care about school for
some time — until he reached the 4th grade, and had Imogene “Teddy” Hill as a teacher.</p>

<p>She did bribe him, with candy and $5 bills from her own money. He quickly became hooked — so</p>

much so that he skipped the 5th grade and went straight to middle school, namely Crittenden Middle School. It was in a poor area. Most kids did not work much there, they were rather fond of bullying other kids, such as the young Steve. One day he came home and declared that if he wasn’t transferred to another school, he would stop going to school altogether. He was 11. Paul and Clara complied, and the Jobses moved to the cozier city of Los Altos, so that Steve could go to Cupertino Junior High. This proved to be decisive for Steve’s future.
</p>

<p>
As Steve was growing up in Los Altos, he became increasingly curious about the world of electronics that filled his neighbors’ garages. His own
father introduced him to Heathkits, which fascinated him.
</p>

<h2>Homestead High</h2>

<p>
When Steve arrived in Homestead High School, he enrolled in a popular electronics class. His teacher was
</p>

<span class="page-number">12</span><div class="book-content">

<p class="no-indent">
Mr. McCollum. McCollum later recalled of one time when his pupil Steve called up David Hewlett himself, co-founder of HP, to get spare parts for his homework, and even a summer job at HP’s factory. Steve’s entrepreneurial skills showed up early in his life indeed.
</p>

<p>

<img class="left-pic zoom-this" src="samples/steve-jobs/pics/highschool.jpg" width="172" height="159">
At Homestead, Steve befriended Bill Fernandez, a neighbor who shared his interests in electronics. It was Bill who first introduced him to another computer whiz kid, an older guy named Stephen Wozniak, or — as everybody used to call him — Woz. Steve and Woz met in 1969, when they were respectively 14 and 19. At the time, Woz was building a little computer board with Bill Fernandez that they called “the Cream Soda Computer”.</p>

<span class="page-number">13</span><div class="book-content">

<blockquote>
Typically, it was really hard for me to explain to people the kind of design stuff I worked on, but Steve got it right away. And I liked him. He was kind of skinny and wiry and full of energy. [...] Steve and I got close right away, even though he was still in high school [...]. We talked electronics, we talked about music we liked, and we traded stories about pranks we’d pulled.
</blockquote>

<cite>Steve Wozniak in iWoz</cite>

<p>
Woz and Steve later engaged in several pranks together, including putting a
huge middle finger on one of the high school’s building.
</p>

<p>
It was also at Homestead that Steve met Chris-Ann Brennan, his first steady girlfriend, with whom he stayed for several years. A couple of years later, Woz and Steve started their first entrepreneurial venture. It was 1972, and on US campuses, there was a lot of talk about “phone phreaks.” They were early computer
